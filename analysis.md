Analysis

Layer 3, Head 1

This head takes the highest attention weight and appears to have learned a very clear diagonal matrix pattern, understanding a word in a sequence of text often depends on knowing what word comes next. Such a pattern is essential for capturing local syntactic and semantic structures, enabling the model to make contextually appropriate predictions for masked or unknown tokens.

Example Sentences:
- The clouds formed beautiful animals in the [MASK].
- The [MASK] we used to share is no longer coherent.

Layer 8, Head 1

This head shows a distinctive focus on Determiners, such as "the," , which is a word that indicates the beginning of a noun phrase. It appears to have learned to recognize the Determiner "the" before a noun and formed a noun phrase accordingly. Its ability to consistently recognize and pair Determiners with their associated nouns showcases its role in constructing syntactic structures essential for natural language understanding.

Example Sentences:
- The clouds formed beautiful animals in the [MASK].
- The [MASK] we used to share is no longer coherent.
